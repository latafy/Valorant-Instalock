# Valorant-Instalock

**How it works:
- Simple valorant instalocking program. Choose your resolution and agent and click select. Use the home button to start and stop the program automatically. Should work on any resolution that you want.

**Features:
- Any agent at ANY resolution
- Automatic instalock with hotkey

**Problems and Bugs:
- Large file size (~85MB)
- Longer start-up time
- May have trouble with certain agents differentiation at very stretched resolutions


Important to note that the speed it locks in an agent is limited on how fast you get off the loading screen.

**Update #1 (5/1): 
- Now can operate at any resolution  (supports all custom resolutions)
- Increase recognition to work on lower resoultions better
- Added Fade to it

**Future Updates:
- Plan to maybe change the scripts language fully to go faster at a smaller size
- Add actual installer/updater to stop from having to reinstall for every new character
