# Valorant-Instalock

**How it works:
- Simple valorant instalocking program. Choose your resolution and agent and click select. Use the home button to start and stop the program automatically. Should work on any resolution that is selectable, currently it only support the resolutions that are given by valorant, but will support any resolution soon.

**Features:
- Any agent for 15 resolutions
- Automatic instalock with hotkey

**Problems and Bugs:
- No custom resolution support
- Large file size (~85MB)
- Longer start-up time
- May have trouble with certain agents differentiation at lowest resolution (such as Sova and Breach who have very similar face colors)


Important to note that the speed it locks in an agent is limited on how fast you get off the loading screen.
