# Valorant-Instalock

How it works:
- Simple valorant instalocking program. Choose your resolution and agent and click select. Use the home button to start and stop the program automatically. Should work on any resolution that you want. Video showing how it works: https://youtu.be/QsayT5TcI9Q

Features:
- Any agent at ANY resolution
- Automatic instalock with hotkey
- Account manager to switch between accounts

Problems and Bugs:
- Large file size (~85MB)
- Longer start-up time
- May have trouble with certain agents differentiation at very stretched resolutions


Important to note that the speed it locks in an agent is limited on how fast you get off the loading screen.
